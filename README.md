# script-archive
A small archive of (very old) scripts I created for some repetitive tasks.
In general, I'll use this for now to archive more such scripts.

**There is no guarantee that any of these work, as I have not tested or maintained any of them for quite some time.** For newly added scripts, I'll try to include some tests if needed.
